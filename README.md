# Soil Nutrients, Bacterial Taxa, and Nitrogen-Fixing Potential Five Years Post-Fire in the Western Cascades, OR
**This project will investigate the effects of the 2020 Lionshead burn stratified by soil burn severity and its effects on soil recovery and nutrient cycling dynamics by assessing the ecology, nutrients, microbes, and N-fixing rates at 40 plots.**
###### As of Fall 2025, this repository will contain just the field data - lab data will be available Winter 2025
### This repository will contain four folder: Data, Code, Figs, and a Readme document to fully reproduce the code and figures contained in this project. For now, we will explore the field data with basic exploratory analysis.
